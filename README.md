# landing-page

This is a miniature project that I have built with HTML and CSS skills learned from The Odin Project. 

Techniques applied to this projct:

HTML:

the sturecture of the website - the blocks and the relationship between containers and its elements (blocks, wording, content)

CSS:
Due to the reality of the webpage layout, Flex feature was mainly used. 

flex-direction
justify-content
align-items 
padding
border-radius 
margin

###Some self-reflect###
Parent - Child relationship in Flex features are important. Sometimes the changes for Flex-values are of no effect may be caused by unclear relationship between the parent container and the child element. 

Don't be scared if the initial version of webpage looks way different than what it supposed to look like. Go back to the HTML file check the logic/relationship between the containters and its child element and ask yourself if this makes sense. Samething should be done for the CSS file.
